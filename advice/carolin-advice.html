			<h4>Perseverence!</h4>
			<p>When you start coding, it can feel like you are learning a foreign language. Well, you are! It may seem difficult at first but keep on and one day that light bulb will go on and then you are well on your way to new and exciting opportunities.</p>

			<p>"Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up." -Thomas Edison</p>

			<h4>Stay motivated!</h4>
			<p>Join a meetup, go to conferences, participate in a hack-a-thon. Whatever it takes, surround yourself with others who are interested in coding and encourage each other.</p>
			
            <h4>Believe in yourself!</h4>
            <p>Don't let others discourage you. I'm 55 years old and now that the kids are all grown, I'm at a point in my life where I have the time and opportunity to do for me! I'm not going to let other people's misconceptions about age/gender hinder me in pursuing my dreams.</p>
